# MachineLearningAutomator
 A C# App that attempts to automate Machine Learning trainning by generating new YAML configurations each session.

This appliction was made for a research paper for CIT/AIE, I wouldn't be half shocked if there are better ways to go about automated testing for dozens/hundreds of trainning sessions using alternate YAML/Trainers.

Should you need this for your own testing for what ever reason, you're more than welcome to use and improve it.
